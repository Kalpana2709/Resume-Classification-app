# Resume Classification using NLP & Streamlit Deployment

This project classifies resumes into specific job categories using NLP techniques and machine learning models. The app is deployed using **Streamlit Cloud** and hosted via **GitHub**.

---

##  Dataset

Resumes in `.docx` format were provided in a ZIP file. Each resume belongs to one of the following categories:

- React Developer
- SQL Developer
- Peoplesoft Resume
- Workday Resume

---

##  Project Workflow

### 1. Data Extraction
- Extracted `.docx` files from ZIP
- Converted to structured CSV format with `Resume` and `Category` columns

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Class distribution plot
- Word count statistics
- Vocabulary insights

### 3. Preprocessing
- Cleaned text: lowercased, removed special characters
- TF-IDF vectorization (`max_features=3000`)
- Label encoding for target categories

### 4. Model Building
Trained 8 ML models:
- Logistic Regression (best )
- Naive Bayes
- SVC
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Bagging
- Voting Classifier

### 5. Evaluation

- Evaluated all 8 models on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Best Performing Model**: `Logistic Regression`  
  - **Accuracy**: 100.00%
  - Selected for final deployment.

### 6. Deployment
- App built using `Streamlit`
- Models saved using `joblib`
- Code & app deployed on GitHub + Streamlit Cloud
